#MusicMe Web App#

This is the MusicMe web application. It depends on:

1. requirejs
2. socket.io
3. SoundManager2
4. EventEmitter

and all of these dependencies are included within this work. The client is modular,
and will load modules when they are needed. (It's also good for maintaining a large project.)

##Support##

The client presently supports Chrome, FireFox and IE9. I will be testing support more extensively
as the project developes, as well as adding support for mobile Webkit browsers.
